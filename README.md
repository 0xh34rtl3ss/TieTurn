## Summary

In this group project, we proposed to develop a mobile application to leverage the issue of conventional booking appointments where people need to be present at the bank each time they want to perform a transaction. Traditional method of booking an appointment is unacceptable because most of the time the bank will be overcrowded with people, thus making the customers uncomfortable and wasting their time waiting for their turn. Hence, the development of this project will ease the use of customers to book an appointment via mobile application. The confirmation of the appointment will then be sent through the customer's email.

## Problem Statement

Physical banking services nowadays are overcrowded with people performing various transactions at the bank such as account opening and fund transfer. Consequently, the number of customers at a time exceeded the number of counters it could handle, which resulted in longer queuing time and require customers to be present at the premises for appointments.

## Objectives

Technology brings impactful changes that can make business flourish.
- To reduce customer's time and effort to accomplish banking needs
- To avoid customer dissatisfaction by minimising unsuccessful or wasted visits

## Features
- Usage of HTTP POST request to an API that send out email to the customer
- Usage of Google Firebase authentication to sign in into the app
